_This app is intended to help you remember to take your pills at an interval.  You assume all responsibility of taking your medicine in accordance with your doctors instructions.  If this app tells you to take 90 Vicodin, and you do it, that's on you.  It is intended to help you take your medicine on an interval, but if you enter the data wrong or there is a bug in my app, you could miss a dosing or be told to overdose.  Please just use common sense and be mindful of your doctor's instructions._
